Users can enter the song lyrics stuck in their head, and our site will return the best match for that song (using MusicXMatch), display the lyrics of the song, show results for any upcoming shows for that artist with a link to buy tickets (using Bands in Town), and then map the locations of the concert venues (using Google Maps)

Background: This project was assigned to our team on a short turn-around deadline (2 weeks). We were a newly formed team that did not have any prior experience working together. We were tasked with creating a user-input-based application, but we were given significant liberty in terms of direction and purpose. To complete our assignment effectively, we needed to provide a solution that met the following requirements:

- Must use at least two APIs
- Must use AJAX to pull data
- Must utilize a new library / technology that we haven't discussed
- Must have a polished frontend /UI
- Must meet good quality coding standards
